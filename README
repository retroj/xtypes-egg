== Description

I made this library because I was writing a program that used both xlib
and xft, and needed certain datatypes that on the one hand behaved like
ordinary scheme objects, and on the other would interoperate with these
two libraries.  The xlib egg is unfortunately a minimal wrapper around C,
and does not provide certain needed abstractions over its datatypes â€” they
are more the most part opaque c-pointers.

This library has been developed on an as-needed basis, rather than a
methodical one.  If there are more datatypes that this library should
handle, please let me know.

Objects instantiated by the make-* constructors in this library have
finalizers set on them, so they will be automatically garbage-collected.

== API
=== XRectangle

<procedure>(make-xrectangle x y width height)</procedure>
<procedure>(xrectangle-x rect)</procedure>
<procedure>(xrectangle-y rect)</procedure>
<procedure>(xrectangle-width rect)</procedure>
<procedure>(xrectangle-height rect)</procedure>
<procedure>(xrectangle-x-set! rect x)</procedure>
<procedure>(xrectangle-y-set! rect y)</procedure>
<procedure>(xrectangle-width-set! rect width)</procedure>
<procedure>(xrectangle-height-set! rect height)</procedure>

Some of these procedures have the same names as procedures in the xlib
egg, so if you are using xtypes and xlib together, you should change your
xlib import form to look like this:

<enscript highlight="scheme">
(use
 (except xlib make-xrectangle
              xrectangle-x xrectangle-y
              xrectangle-width xrectangle-height)
 xtypes)
</enscript>


=== XGlyphInfo

<procedure>(make-xglyphinfo)</procedure>
<procedure>(xglyphinfo-x xginfo)</procedure>
<procedure>(xglyphinfo-y xginfo)</procedure>
<procedure>(xglyphinfo-width xginfo)</procedure>
<procedure>(xglyphinfo-height xginfo)</procedure>
<procedure>(xglyphinfo-xoff xginfo)</procedure>
<procedure>(xglyphinfo-yoff xginfo)</procedure>


=== XRenderColor

The channel values of an xrendercolor are all normalized to a decimal
number between 0.0 and 1.0.

<procedure>(make-xrendercolor r g b [a])</procedure>
<procedure>(xrendercolor-red color)</procedure>
<procedure>(xrendercolor-green color)</procedure>
<procedure>(xrendercolor-blue color)</procedure>
<procedure>(xrendercolor-alpha color)</procedure>
